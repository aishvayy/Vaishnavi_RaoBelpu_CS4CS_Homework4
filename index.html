                <p class="feedback-intro">Feedback for the course:</p>
                <p>The course "Software Development and its Applications" has helped me hone my skills as a programmer
                    by
                    creating a structure for my learnings.<br /> I got the opportunity to revisit my
                    understanding of the C programming language, that solidified my basics of Object Oriented
                    Programming,
                    the most essential tool in the box of a well-rounded programmer. <br /> The lectures were online,
                    which
                    caused a slight disconnect in the initial days of my classes, however my Professor, Dr. Hasan Dag,
                    made
                    this tediousness easier by not only explaining concepts in an easy-to-follow manner, but also being
                    readily available online to answer all my queries. <br /> We started the course with OOP concepts
                    and
                    slowly built our way up to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; and my favourite part of the course has
                    definitely
                    been the creative programming challenges given to us as homework. The questions have been crafted
                    with
                    an eye for ensuring the smallest lessons are driven home when we sit down to solve it. <br />
                    Overall,
                    my experience has been very rewarding and enriching, and I hope to take the learnings with me for a
                    long
                    time.</p>

            <section class="learnings">
                <article>
                    <p class="learning-intro">I will write a paragraph for each methodology of <a
                            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/"
                            target="_blank">SDLC</a>. There are many of them but I will suggest a few. My suggestion and
                        reasons are as follows:</p>
                    <p>(a) <b><i>The Waterfall Model</i></b>: Although not very widely used in software/product development these
                        days, I
                        have included the Waterfall Model as it is the fundamental SDLC model from which all other SDLC
                        models have evolved. The disadvantages are often talked about, the biggest being that it leaves
                        very
                        little to no room for changes once a particular phase is completed, rendering it unflexible. I
                        will
                        discuss its nature and advantages which have made it so popular in its early days of use. The
                        Waterfall Model is named thus because of the linear and logical manner in which projects that
                        follow
                        this model proceed, resembling the way water flows off cliffs in a waterfall. As pointed out
                        earlier, there is rarely any scope for change or client/end user feedback in the multiple phases
                        of
                        a waterfall model - this means that requirements must be clearly defined initially, while also
                        paying specific attention to good documentation, the cornerstone of any good product. Projects
                        adhering to the Waterfall Model are very well documented which make it an attractive option. A
                        common feature of the Waterfall Model which makes it a good choice for projects with a huge team
                        size and ample resources is its clearly defined steps. Each phase of the Waterfall Model depends
                        solely on the output of the previous phase, thereby making project management easier on a high
                        level
                        for complicated projects to simplify end goals. Based on all the previously described points, it
                        follows that projects that choose the Waterfall Model are always well-structured, have barely
                        any
                        change in expectations versus the final outcome, and are very suitable in places where a fixed
                        timeline for the project is of utmost importance, along with the need for an application to work
                        out
                        of the box at the first try. All the advantages also pose as disadvantages as projects following
                        this model are at risk of losing customers.<br /><br />
                        (b)<b><i>The V Model</i></b>: The V Model, sometimes referred to as the "Verification" or "Validation" model,
                        is
                        thus named for the structure of its different phases from requirements gathering to module
                        design
                        and coding, each of which is associated with its own testing phase, which form two legs of the
                        letter 'V'. This consistent testing ensures that money allocated to the project is utilised
                        effectively, as major errors and issues are addressed at every phase before the start of the
                        next
                        one. Such a model also improves the group dynamics of a project by achieving an efficient level
                        of
                        collaboration between the development and testing teams, which makes it an incredibly attractive
                        option for senstive projects like defense and aerospace research. The V Model gives a
                        disciplined
                        approach to project management while also providing quality assurance of the end product because
                        of
                        the high emphasis on constant testing and feedback from the testing team. <br /> <br />(c) <b><i>The
                        Spiral Model</i></b>: In the third model of software development, I will be shedding light on the Spiral
                        Model, a risk-driven SDLC. A combination of the Waterfall and the Iterative Models, this SDLC
                        methodology lays special emphasis on risk management through its many phases. It is called a
                        Spiral
                        Model because of its diagrammatic representation of a spiral, each loop pertaining to one
                        particular
                        phase of the project. The number of phases of this SDLC are dynamic and determined by the
                        manager,
                        with continuous risk analysis and feedback from the clients that are subject to changes. With
                        this
                        kind of flexibility, it is well suited for large projects that come with high levels of risk.
                        The
                        spiral is divided into four quadrants, with the radius at any point depicting the cost incurred
                        and
                        the angular dimensions represent the progress made. With one spiral depicting the step-wise
                        planning
                        nature of the Waterfall Model, the repeated spirals depict further iterations to refine the
                        process
                        and come back to redefining some core characteristics of the project based on the risk analysis.
                        <br /> <br />
                        <i>Among so many SDLC methodologies, the ones that are in the Agile classification are better.
                        Agile
                        SDLC model offers a flexible and iterative approach to software development, promoting
                        continuous
                        collaboration, rapid delivery, and responsiveness to change. Among Agile SDLC methods, I have
                        the
                        following suggestions</i>:<br /><br />(a)<b><i> Scrum Methodology</i></b>: One of the newest SDLCs catered to the

                        mindset to approach software development in small, manageable iterations called "sprints". Each
                        sprint comes with its own set of deliverables, which include a recurring phase of requirements
                        gathering, refining, development, testing, incremental release of features of the product. The
                        sprint lasts an average of two weeks, with enhanced communication between various teams - from
                        security to product to development to testing, and each meeting referred to as a "scrum", where
                        the
                        team gets together to discuss the deliverables of the sprint/week/day, depending on what suits
                        their
                        needs. This not only improves the group dynamics of a team, but also facilitates quick project
                        completion with an eye for customer satisfaction as end-user testing at the end of every sprint
                        calls for reviews from the client and incorporating them into the following
                        sprint.<br /><br />(b)<b><i>
                        Crystal Agile Methodology</i></b>: This is a lightweight Agile framework best suited for small projects
                        with
                        developers working out of a single workspace to large projects with an expanded team size. It is
                        also divided into different colour codes like Crystal Orange, Crystal Diamond, Crystal Maroon,
                        etc.,
                        based on the nature of risk to human life in the project. Some colours correspond to large team
                        sizes such as Crystal Diamond and Sapphire, and others such as Crystal Clear are for small teams
                        of
                        1-6 members. This method allows team members to take more control and freely exchange ideas
                        within
                        the team for the benefit of the product and user satisfaction.<br /><br />(c)<b><i> Feature Driven
                        Development</i></b>: This Agile methodology was first applied in the year 1997, and involves first
                        creating
                        an overall model, then developing the model feature-by-feature. It is best suited for small
                        iterations and therefore suitable for complex projects where the product is launched
                        efficiently, is
                        feature focused, and customer oriented.<br /><br />(d)<b><i>Dynamic Software Development Method</i></b>: This
                        Agile methodology is based on the principle that 80% of any product can be delivered in 20% of
                        the
                        overall time set aside for the project. This means that in every iteration, just <i>enough</i>
                        work
                        is done in building and shipping the features on top of which the other features are built in
                        subsequent iterations.<br /><br />(e) <b><i>Extreme Programming</i></b>: This model of Agile is
                        customer-first. It
                        involves implementing features based on "User Stories", where features are described by product
                        managers based on user requirements. Intensive coding follows this, which has intra-team code
                        reviews, testing (both unit and integration), and also Continuous Integration - where all code
                        is
                        maintained and shared on a common repository. Paired with scrum, this often produces very
                        efficient
                        results in the development of a software.

                    <p>In this Software Development and Applications course of <a
                            href="https://www.srh-university.de/en/" target="_blank">SRH</a>, we learnt the
                        following:<br />(a) Basics of
                        object-oriented programming<br />(b) Implementation of OOP concepts with C programming language,
                        starting from simple programs like printing "Hello world" to understanding data structures like
                        arrays, structs, and linked lists.<br />(c) Thereafter, we also learnt how to build webpages
                        similar
                        to the one you are reading with the help of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br />(d) No software
                        development is complete without learning about the various methodologies of building a software,
                        where we discussed different life cycles of delivering softwares like Waterfall, V, and Agile,
                        to
                        name a few. Emphasis was given to Agile as the preferred methodology of building softwares in
                        today's world.<br />(e) Our learnings were thoroughly tested with weekly homeworks on each of
                        the
                        concepts mentioned above.</p><br />
                    <p>
                        I have used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a> on my webpage. The
                        three ways to include CSS in a webpage are as follows:<br />(a) External CSS: This method allows
                        us
                        to include CSS for the entire webpage in a single, separate file. This is added by including a
                        link
                        to the location of the CSS file (with a ".css" extension) in the "link" element inside the
                        "head"
                        section of the HTML. For the purposes of this webpage, an external CSS has been used. For
                        example: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;<br /> (b)
                        Internal CSS: This method of styling is used if a unique style is added to the HTML webpage, and
                        is
                        included by writing all the required styles enclosed within the "style" tags of the "head"
                        section
                        of the HTML code. For example: &lt;style&gt; body { background-color: lightblue; }
                        &lt;/style&gt; <br /> (c) Inline CSS: Inline CSS is mainly used when we need to add styles to
                        a
                        singular element of the webpage, be it an article, or a section. To include inline CSS, we
                        simply
                        add the "style" attribute with any HTML element. For example: &lt;h1 style="color:
                        red;"&gt;Welcome to My Webpage&lt;/h1&gt; <br /> <br /> The reasons CSS is used in a
                        webpage
                        are as follows: <br /> (a) CSS ("Cascading Style Sheets") are a way for us to design our
                        webpages.
                        It allows us to add any number of unique styles to our website, thereby making it visually
                        appealing. <br />(b) CSS allows us to control how we want our website and the HTML which is the
                        skeleton of the site to look on a browser. <br /> (c) CSS allows us to present our website in an
                        easy to understand format by the end user, by adding structure to our site and paint the layout
                        in
                        an artistic manner.<br /> (d) CSS can be used to add effects such as animations to our website,
                        or
                        for simple things like text styling as well. This enhances the design of the website, similar to
                        how
                        a work of art becomes attractive when we paint the basic layout with colours. <br /> <br /> We
                        also
                        use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> in webpage
                        development.
                        The main reasons are as follows: <br /> (a) JavaScript is one of the 3 main languages of web
                        development, the other 2 being HTML and CSS. <br /> (b) JavaScript allows us to program the
                        behaviour of a website. <br /> (c) JavaScript's utilities include dynamically updating the
                        content
                        of a website, control multimedia, and implement other complex features. <br /> (c) HTML and CSS
                        allow us to define the structure and design of a website - JavaScript controls everything else,
                        from
                        security to displaying interactive maps. Basically, everytime our website does something more
                        than
                        just displaying information to the user, JavaScript is what allows this interaction. This can be
                        something like defining what happens when a user clicks on a button that triggers another
                        action.
                        <br /> (d) JavaScript enables storage of information inside variables, operations on pieces of
                        texts
                        (commonly referred to as strings), and essentially, allows a website to come to life and makes
                        it
                        useful to a customer. When a user places an order on a shopping site, it is JavaScript that
                        contains
                        the logic of how a cart is updated or how the user's choice of product is stored.
